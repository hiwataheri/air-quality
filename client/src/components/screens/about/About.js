      <h2 > Clean air is vital for your city's health and prosperity!</h2>
     <p>Long-term exposure from living in polluted cities increases the chance of premature death and cancer, and lung and heart conditions.The people most at risk are young children, the elderly and people with pre-existing health conditions. Children – whose lungs and immune systems are still developing – born and raised in areas of high air pollution are likely to develop asthma, have several years taken off their life expectancy and are up to four times more likely to have significantly reduced lung function in adulthood. 
     Pollution causes:Indoor and outdoor air pollution kills around 7 million people each year. And many more suffer from related conditions such premature birth, low birth weight and asthma.4

People are breathing unsafe air in over 80% of cities globally. This rises to 97% of cities in low- and middle-income countries.5 Check whether your city’s air is safe using the graphic below, which shows annual concentrations of PM2.56.You can find out more about the air pollution in your city using our Air Quality Explorer, and at BreatheLife. To find out the number of deaths due to poor air quality in your country visit State of Global Air.
economic consequences
The healthcare cost of air pollution is vast. In London, it contributed to between 3,500 and 9,400 deaths, and over £3.7 billion in healthcare costs in 2010.7

Poor air quality hits cities’ economies. In 2015, air pollution cost Mumbai and Delhi US $10.66 billion, or 0.71% of India’s GDP.8 It costs the global economy approximately US $225 billion a year in health-related lost labour alone.9

Residents leave cities in search of cleaner air. In Delhi, severe air pollution is causing a talent drain and a fall in property prices, while Beijing is losing residents to ‘smog migration,’ as highly-educated people seek an escape from dirty air.10, 11

Smog forces temporary school closures and pushes parents to keep their children indoors. In Delhi, all 6,000 schools have been closed in the worst smog events.12 Smog also causes flight cancellations and traffic accidents due to the loss of visibility, including in cities in Pakistan, Malaysia and India.13, 14

Business recruitment suffers. The majority of United States firms operating in Chinese cities struggle to recruit senior talent from abroad because of air pollution concerns.15 In 2014, Panasonic became the first international company to offer ‘hardship posting’ compensation to expat employees in China because of the country’s air quality.
